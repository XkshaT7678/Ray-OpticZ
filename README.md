# PHYMULATOR 2024 - Ray Optics Simulation

## üåü Event Overview
**PHYMULATOR (Simulation in Physics)**

**Category:** Physics Integrated with AI  
**Participants:** Akshat Kumar & Dikshant Jha
**Class:** X D  
**School:** DAV Public School, Sector 7, Rohini Delhi  

## üìö Project Title
**Ray Optics Simulation**

## üîç Project Description
Dive into the fascinating world of light with our interactive ray optics simulation! This project demonstrates the principles of light refraction, specifically designed for the Class X physics curriculum. Our simulation aims to visualize how light behaves when it encounters different media, providing a hands-on learning experience for students.

### Key Features
- **Interactive Visualization:** Users can adjust parameters such as the angle of incidence and the refractive indices of different media to observe real-time changes in the path of light rays.
- **Educational Insights:** The simulation offers detailed explanations of concepts like refraction, Snell's Law, critical angle, and total internal reflection, making complex theories more accessible.
- **AI Integration:** Basic AI algorithms are used to predict the path of light based on user inputs, enhancing the learning experience by providing immediate feedback and visualization.

## üõ† Development Platform
We are using **Replit** as our coding platform to develop and run the simulation. Replit allows us to collaborate in real-time and ensures our project is accessible from any device.
